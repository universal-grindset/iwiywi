It Works If You Work It — twelve daily AA readings in your terminal, classified to the Steps.

## Install

**Homebrew**

```
brew install universal-grindset/iwiywi/iwiywi
```

**Cargo**

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/universal-grindset/iwiywi
```

## Usage

```
# Open the pulse — slow cycle of readings, prayers, Steps, and more
iwiywi

# Force a refresh of today's readings
iwiywi fetch

# Install the 6am launchd job (macOS)
iwiywi install
```

Keys: `n` next · `p` previous · `r` random · `q` quit · `1`–`9` `0` `-` `=` focus on Step N · `*` clear focus.

## Features

- Twelve daily AA readings, classified to a Step, refreshed every morning at 6am
- A pulse that quietly cycles your readings + the public-domain Big Book + the 12 Steps + the 12 Principles + the 12 Traditions + the 12 Concepts + 30 slogans + standard AA prayers + Grapevine Quote of the Day
- Six env-var knobs for pacing, color, pattern, order, focus, and theme
- Auto-fetches today's readings when you open it with no data for the day
- Adaptive light/dark detection from your terminal background

## Choices

iwiywi pulses through AA content. Six env vars tune the experience:

```sh
# Pacing
export IWIYWI_PULSE_SECS=20      # default 20s; 0 = manual-only

# Color
export IWIYWI_THEME=auto         # light | dark | auto
export IWIYWI_PALETTE=default    # default warm cool mono sunset sage dawn dusk

# Visual
export IWIYWI_PATTERN=none       # none dots frame rule

# Cycling
export IWIYWI_ORDER=random       # random sequential by-step by-source

# Restrict to one kind of content
export IWIYWI_FOCUS=all          # all today history big_book prayers steps
                                 # principles grapevine traditions concepts slogans
```

## How it works

`iwiywi fetch` scrapes AA daily-reading sources (with a Wayback Machine fallback), asks the configured LLM to classify each to one of the twelve Steps with a short reason, writes the result to `~/.iwiywi/readings-<date>.json`, renders a Markdown view, and publishes it to a GitHub Gist via `gh`. The gist URL is what the QR overlay encodes — scan it and GitHub renders the page on your phone. `iwiywi install` writes a launchd plist that runs `iwiywi fetch` at 6:00 local time. `iwiywi` (no args) reads today's file (auto-fetches if missing) and renders the TUI.

### Choosing an AI provider

iwiywi speaks the OpenAI chat-completions API. Two configurations are supported out of the box:

**Vercel AI Gateway** (default):
```toml
# ~/.iwiywi/config.toml
[ai]
model = "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5"
gateway_url = "https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v1"
```
```sh
# ~/.iwiywi/.env
VERCEL_AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN=<your token>
```

**Azure OpenAI** (or AI Foundry):
```toml
[ai]
model = "gpt-4o-mini"   # = your deployment name
gateway_url = "https://<RESOURCE>.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/<DEPLOYMENT>"
api_version = "2024-08-01-preview"
```
```sh
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key>
```

Setting `api_version` flips the auth header from `Authorization: Bearer` to `api-key:` and appends `?api-version=…` to the URL.

`gh` CLI authenticated (`gh auth login` with `gist` scope) is required for gist publishing.

## What pulses

The pulse cycles through:

- **Today's readings** — the day's classified readings.
- **Historical readings** — every prior `readings-*.json` saved in `~/.iwiywi/`.
- **Big Book quotes** — verbatim passages from the public-domain portion (pp. 1–164).
- **The 12 Steps** — verbatim text of each Step.
- **The 12 Principles** — Honesty, Hope, Faith, Courage, Integrity, Willingness, Humility, Brotherly Love, Justice, Perseverance, Spirituality, Service.
- **The 12 Traditions** — verbatim long-form.
- **The 12 Concepts for World Service** — verbatim long-form.
- **AA prayers** — Serenity, Third Step, Seventh Step, Eleventh Step (St. Francis), Set Aside, Acceptance, the Promises.
- **AA slogans** — HALT, One Day at a Time, Easy Does It, Live and Let Live, and 26 more.
- **Grapevine** — daily Quote of the Day from grapevine.org, with a bundled fallback.

`IWIYWI_FOCUS` restricts the pulse to one of these kinds. Pressing a number key (`1`–`9`, `0`=10, `-`=11, `=`=12) focuses to one Step until you press `*`.

<summary>Troubleshooting</summary>

**"No readings for today."** — Run `iwiywi fetch` once. Readings are keyed by local date. (Or just open `iwiywi` — it auto-fetches.)

**`VERCEL_AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN not set`.** — Add it to `~/.iwiywi/.env`. (Or switch to Azure — see "Choosing an AI provider" above.)

**`AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY not set`.** — Add it to `~/.iwiywi/.env`. Required when `api_version` is set in `config.toml`.

**Colors look wrong.** — Set `IWIYWI_THEME=light` or `IWIYWI_THEME=dark` explicitly, or pick a different `IWIYWI_PALETTE`.

**launchd job didn't run.** — `launchctl list | grep iwiywi` to confirm it's loaded, and check `~/Library/Logs/iwiywi.log`.
